Soil nutrient status, crop requirements are given importance while formulating this product. Boracol BSF – 12 can be readily mixed with other NPK fertilizers and applied in the active root zone.",
    "Recommendation": "We recommend applying 10 kg Boracol BSF – 12 with NPK and SatRite.  For majority of the short duration crops it should be applied once with basal dose or first NPK dose. For Irrigated Cotton, it should be applied @ 10 kg per acre with first NPK dose and the second dose should be coincided with flowering / square formation.  However for Tomato, Brinjal, Chilli and Capsicum, it should be applied twice. The second application of Boracol BSF – 12 should be separated by 45 days from first application, usually at the time of initial Fruit Growth and Development Stage of a crop. For Grapes, it should be applied @ 10 kg per acre with NPK dose at the time of April Pruning and October pruning.",
